        Hello, my name is Michelle, and I'm currently in my senior year majoring in Economics and minoring in UX. I'd like to take a moment to share some thoughts about this website and my experiences in this course. When I started, I had ambitious plans for the site, but managing four courses simultaneously meant working within a tight schedule. Despite these constraints, I am pleased with the outcome of my efforts. This project has been a valuable learning experience, emphasizing the importance of continued growth in programming and the application of best practices. I thoroughly enjoyed this course and am eagerly looking forward to exploring backend development in course 364 next semester.
